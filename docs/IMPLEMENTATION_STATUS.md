## Critical Missing Components

### 1. Database Layer (HIGH PRIORITY)

- **DynamoDB Table Setup**: No actual database tables created
- **Repository Implementations**: Still using mock/in-memory data
- **Data Access Layer**: No real data persistence
- **Migration Strategy**: No database migration system

### 2. API Development (HIGH PRIORITY)

- **85% of Planned APIs Missing**: Only transactions API partially implemented
- **Data Validation**: Zod schemas not integrated with APIs
- **Error Handling**: No standardized API error responses
- **Security**: No rate limiting or input sanitization

### 3. Core UI Workflows (MEDIUM PRIORITY)

- **CRUD Modals**: No creation/editing interfaces for main entities
- **Form Components**: Missing complex forms for budget/debt management
- **Data Loading States**: No proper loading/error UI patterns
- **Navigation**: Missing breadcrumbs and deep linking

### 4. Business Logic Integration (MEDIUM PRIORITY)

- **Budget Engine**: Business logic exists but not connected to UI
- **Debt Calculations**: Service layer complete but UI integration partial
- **Transaction Splitting**: Not implemented despite being in plan
- **Recurring Transactions**: Completely missing

### 5. Production Readiness (LOW PRIORITY)

- **Environment Configuration**: Missing production env vars
- **Error Monitoring**: No error tracking integration
- **Performance Optimization**: No caching or optimization
- **Security Hardening**: Basic auth only, no additional security layers

2. Add proper validation and error handling
3. Integrate with database layer
4. Add API documentation

### Phase 3: UI Completion (3-4 weeks)

1. Build missing CRUD modals and forms
2. Complete remaining pages (account details, budget creation, etc.)
3. Add proper loading states and error handling
4. Implement complex workflows (debt settlement, transaction splitting)

### Phase 4: Advanced Features (2-3 weeks)

1. Recurring transactions
2. Reports and analytics
3. Export functionality
4. Performance optimization

### Phase 5: Production Readiness (1-2 weeks)

1. Security hardening
2. Error monitoring
3. Performance testing
4. Deployment configuration

## Strengths of Current Implementation

1. **Excellent Foundation**: Strong TypeScript types and component architecture
2. **Good Testing Culture**: Comprehensive test setup and coverage for implemented features
3. **Modern Stack**: Well-chosen technologies with good maintainability
4. **Clean Architecture**: Clear separation of concerns and domain modeling
5. **UI/UX Quality**: Professional-looking interface with good accessibility

## Areas of Concern

1. **Database Gap**: Critical blocker for production deployment
2. **API Coverage**: Massive gap in backend functionality
3. **Feature Integration**: Business logic exists but not connected to UI
4. **User Workflows**: Missing end-to-end user experiences
5. **Data Persistence**: Everything is still mock data

The project shows excellent engineering practices and architectural decisions, but significant work remains to achieve the full vision outlined in the feature plan.
